# Assessing Melbourne's Employment and Housing Correlations
## Aim
This project aims to Find the correlation between the price of housing and the rate of employment in the City of Melbourne. Data are visualised in graphs.
## Summary
This report answers the follwing question: "**Do the increase in employment rates contribute to the rise of property prices in Melbourne?**" Both house and apartment prices are analysed with respect to employment rates from 2002 to 2016 throughout the City of Melbourne. However, the geographical scope indicate that this project may be used as a reference for other suburbs across Victoria and Australia. This project uses two datasets:
* 'Median House Prices - By Type and Sale Year': https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Property-Planning/Median-House-Prices-By-Type-and-Sale-Year/i8px-csib 
* 'Employment by Block by Industry': https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Economy/Employment-by-block-by-industry/b36j-kiy4 
## Guide
This project corresponds to Phases 2, 3 and 4 of the Elements of Data Processing (COMP20008) subject at the University of Melbourne. Phase 2 involves creating the draft and proposal of the report while Phase 3 involves the final report (found in 'Assessing Melbourne's Employment and Housing Correlations.pdf'). Phase 4 is made in the form of presentation, which slides can be found in 'Presentation.pdf' or 'Presentation.pptx'. 
The code for the entire project can be found in 'Code.ipynb' and includes a readme at 'Code_README'. The datasets are also provided in this repository.
